As you continue to work with the Adventure Works customer data, you must create queries for reports that have been requested by the sales team.
Retrieve a list of customer companies
You have been asked to provide a list of all customer companies in the format Customer ID : Company Name - for example, 78: Preferred Bikes

````sql
select CustomerID
    , CompanyName

Retrieve customer contact names with middle names if known
You have been asked to write a query that returns a list of customer names. The list must consist of a single column in the format first last (for example Keith Harris) 
if the middle name is unknown, or first middle last (for example Jane M. Gates) if a middle name is known

and a second column named PrimaryContact that contains the email address if known, and otherwise the phone number.

````sql
